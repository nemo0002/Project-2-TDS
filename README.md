# Autolysis - Automated Analysis Tool

**Autolysis** is an automated analysis tool designed to process and visualize data from CSV files. The script is built to handle multiple categories of data, including **Goodreads**, **Happiness**, and **Media**, providing easy-to-interpret visual outputs for each. This repository contains the core Python script and the output files.

## Project Overview

Autolysis automates the analysis of CSV files, extracting meaningful insights and generating visualizations such as charts, graphs, or images. The tool allows for streamlined data processing and quick visual feedback, making it a helpful resource for data-driven decision-making in various domains, including book ratings (Goodreads), personal happiness (Happiness), and media consumption patterns (Media).

### Features:
- **Automated CSV Processing**: The script processes different categories of CSV data automatically.
- **Data Visualization**: The analysis results are presented as visual outputs, including `.png` images.
- **Category-wise Output**: The results are categorized into three distinct folders: `goodreads/`, `happiness/`, and `media/`.

## Repository Structure

- `autolysis.py`: The core Python script responsible for processing the data and generating visual outputs.
- `goodreads/`: Directory containing images generated from Goodreads-related CSV data.
- `happiness/`: Directory containing images generated from Happiness-related CSV data.
- `media/`: Directory containing images generated from Media-related CSV data.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-ID]/autolysis.git
   cd autolysis

### Key Updates:
- The **Project Overview** now reflects the automated analysis and visualization of CSV data from multiple categories.
- Instructions in the **How to Use** section focus on processing and visualizing data, and running the script.
- The **Output Files** section explains that the generated files are `.png` visualizations placed in category-based folders.
